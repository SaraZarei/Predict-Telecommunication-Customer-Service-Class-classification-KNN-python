# classification_KNN_python
A telecommunications provider has segmented its customers by service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four groups. the company can customize offers for individual customers. It is a classification problem. That is, given the dataset, with predefined labels, we need to build a model to be used to predict class of a new or unknown case. The target field, called custcat, has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows: 1- Basic Service 2- E-Service 3- Plus Service 4- Total Service Our objective is to build a classifier, to predict the class of unknown cases. We will use a specific type of classification called K nearest neighbour.
## libraries and functions
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit learn
## Analysis
we can see k=10 is the best accuracy equql to  0.8
